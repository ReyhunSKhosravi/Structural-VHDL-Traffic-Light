# Structural-VHDL-Traffic-Light
VHDL implementation of a traffic light controller for a four-way intersection. This project includes a frequency divider, binary counter, and traffic light system with structural design methodology, ensuring no process statements are used. Ideal for FPGA development and digital logic design learning.
